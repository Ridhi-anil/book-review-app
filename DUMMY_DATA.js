        review:"A beautifully written book. It makes you realize that rather than running away from problems, one should tackle them head on.The character growth throughout the novel is fascinating, as each individual's perception of others changes over time. This reflects the very human tendency to judge based on limited information, it highlights how easily we misinterpret each other and most importantly how a break can heal so many things."

        review:"This is my absolute favourite book Mr Darcy was so in love with Elizabeth but didn’t now how to express it so he hid it and came off as prideful and rude when he was simply just so taken aback by her. And Elizabeth is such an amazing women for her time she spoke out for what she believed but due to the time was seen as an annoyance and rude but she was simply just smart. And she didn’t focus on getting a husband like her sister she wanted to be happy and she didn’t think twice about rejecting mr Darcy. And I love how Jane Austen writes about the sisters Jane the oldest is the prettiest but very bad at sharing her feeling and emotions which leads her to lose the man she loves as he believes she doesn’t feel the same. Mary is the middle child and so vastly different from her sisters because she loves different things and she’s quiet and hates party’s and in the end doesn’t get a husband which is so sad and Jane Austen actually named her Mary because she hated her sister in law named Mary so she named the sister with the saddest ending after her. And kitty and Lydia are such a beautiful representation of younger sisters they try their hardest to be older because they feel left out and often come out as loud and obnoxious "

         review:"this novel is truly a work of art, it is the quintessential crime novel, with not only an intriguing plot, where every chapter builds upon the previous, but also an incredibly well realized environment and characters, where I personally could not help but sympathize with the protagonist in his struggle with his inner demons and his desperate struggle to keep up appearances of normalcy and innocence as he grows more weary and disheveled by the day. Furthermore, this book explores a few though provoking concepts in moderate detail that will leave a person thinking and reflecting on said ideas.However what I really enjoyed was the brilliant dialogue between characters, my favorite scene being when Raskolnikov had a sort of a battle of wits in the police station with Svidrigailov, which got intense and heated very quickly. Overall, this is a must read for anyone who is even remotely interested in Russian Literature."

         review:"Wow! After all the buzzing hype surrounding this book that never seems to diminish, I finally decided it was time to dive in and award myself some entertaining popcorn reading. However, oh boy, this book absolutely deserves every bit of its never-ending hype. It exceeded my expectations, had me gritting my teeth, squirming restlessly in my seat, and, even though I anticipated the delicious twist from the beginning, I still admired how the author perfectly developed this smart cat-and-mouse game. The last third, in particular, was exceptionally brilliant! I knew right from the beginning that I would enjoy this heart-throbbing, jaw-dropping, unputdownable, twisty psychological thriller, but I didn't expect to love it even more and immediately decided to jump into the next book of the series, despite some reviews emphasizing that it might not be as good as the first one. I just couldn't resist spending more time in Millie the maid's disturbing, mind-bending world!"
